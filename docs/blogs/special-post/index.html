    <h2>103 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10003</h2>
    <p>
      I first tried Penny Farthing during my freshman year of college and immediately became addicted to it.
      They have amazing fries that pair nicely with their slider appetizer and their steak salad.
      It has a fun atmosphere and has great outdoor seating during warmer weather.
